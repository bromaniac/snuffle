This is my revision of Ralph Merkle's SNEFRU program.  Snefru is a one-way
hash algorithm:  given some input text, Snefru will come up with a single
number.  No two texts will hash down to the same number.  (Think of it as
a super-strong checksum.)

I completely rewrote and reorganized the code that Ralph has made
available.  For example, I split the comments out into manual pages, and
put all the tests out into a separate program.  What I'm making available
is a derived work, and therefore must be distributed under the same terms
as Ralph's original code.  Thanks to him and Xerox for making his work
available.  Some of the programs and manual pages are my work, and
therefore don't contain the Xerox copyright.  They are in the public
domain, and feel free to do what you want with them.

This code needs a 32bit machine; good luck trying to port it elsewhere!
To compile, edit the Makefile if you use strchr/strrchr rather than
index/rindex.  Also edit snefru.c to determine the byte order of your
machine.
